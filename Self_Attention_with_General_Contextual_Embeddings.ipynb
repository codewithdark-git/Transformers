        "This notebook delves into the fundamental concept of **self-attention**, a key mechanism behind modern natural language processing (NLP) models like Transformers. Self-attention enables models to capture the relationships between words in a sequence, irrespective of their distance, making it a cornerstone of contextual word embeddings.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **General Contextual Embeddings**:\n",
        "   - Contextual embeddings represent words based on their meaning in a specific context, as opposed to static embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe. These embeddings dynamically adjust based on surrounding words, capturing semantic nuances.\n",
        "   - In this notebook, we begin by creating a co-occurrence-based embedding space to represent words and their relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dot Product Similarity for Attention Scores**:\n",
        "   - The **dot product similarity** is used to compute attention scores between words in the embedding space.\n",
        "   - These scores reflect how much \"attention\" one word should pay to another, forming the foundation for self-attention computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Softmax Transformation**:\n",
        "   - To normalize attention scores into probabilities, the **softmax function** is applied. This ensures the scores are interpretable as weights, summing up to 1 for each word's attention distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Matrix Transformation for Contextualization**:\n",
        "   - Using the attention weights, embeddings are transformed to encode contextual information. This highlights how the self-attention mechanism allows words to dynamically incorporate meaning based on their surroundings.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Purpose and Applications**\n",

        "- How self-attention computes relationships between words using similarity measures.\n",
        "- The role of softmax normalization in translating similarity scores into probabilistic attention distributions.\n",
        "- The process of generating **contextual embeddings** that capture nuanced word meanings based on their context.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid grasp of self-attention, its mathematical foundation, and its role in generating contextual embeddings, paving the way for deeper exploration of Transformer-based architectures like BERT, GPT, and beyond.\n"
